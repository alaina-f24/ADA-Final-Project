# ADA Final Project

## Project Description
This repository includes the SEER cervical cancer dataset and R markdown code used
to analyze it. This is a final project for the Advanced Data Analysis course, practicing with real-world data and creating a full data analysis project.

## Files Included
- `SEER_cerv.csv`: Raw data downloaded from SEER stat, 22 Registries (excluded IL, MA), Nov 2024 release
- `Final_Project.Rmd`: Annotated R script used to summarize, visualize, and analyze the data
- `README.md`: This file

## What the Code Does
- Reads in the SEER dataset
- Performs basic data cleaning (e.g., renaming columns, filtering)
- Creates summary statistics (e.g., age, gender, responses)
- Generates Kaplan-Meier plots to visualize the data
- Runs unadjusted and adjusted survival analyses
- Tests assumptions for survival regression model

## How to Run the Code
1. Download or clone this repository to your computer
2. Open `Final_Project.Rmd` in RStudio
3. Make sure your working directory is set to the folder where the files are
saved
4. Run the script
